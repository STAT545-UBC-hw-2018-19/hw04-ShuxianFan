# Homework 04: Tidy data and joins - Shuxian Fan

This is the GitHub depository of Shuxian Fan for the [homework04](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw04/hw04.html) of STAT545A.

The goal of this homework is to solidify the data wrangling skills by working some realistic problems in the grey area between data aggregation and data reshaping.

Here are the links for the corresponding files:

## _For the peer reviewer_: 

Please take a look at the html file where I explored some features of kableExtra that help making neat tables. In the GitHub page of the html file, you will find this message:

> (Sorry about that, but we canâ€™t show files that are this big right now.)

This is because the size of the file I generated is too large for GitHub to enable preview.

You could view the content by the: 

[HTML_Preview](https://rawgit.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-ShuxianFan/master/hw04_data_wrangling.html) 
,which I created using [RawGit](https://rawgit.com).

OR:

Here is a guideline of how you can download and view my work:

(1) Go to the html preview page, where you will find the message above.

(2) Right click the Download button on the up right corner

(3) Select "Download Linked File"

(4) Change the file suffix to .html (you might find the downloaded file ends with .txt)

(5) Open the downloaded file and view my work! :wink:

For your convenience :wink:, here you can find the [peer review](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/peer-review.html) page and the [assignments page](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/) which stores the general evaluation rubrics.
